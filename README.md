# Binary-Tree-Node-Balance-Factor Algorithm
This problem consists of observing a binary tree and determining the balance factor. To be more explicit 
the balance factor of a binary tree is the height difference between its right and left subtree. To obtain 
the balance factor of the internal nodes, we can use the Euler tour traversal by defining “pre visit” and 
“post visit” events for each position. The Euler tour traversal involves walking around the tree and 
visiting each node.
